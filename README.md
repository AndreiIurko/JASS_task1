# JASS 2024 Admission assignment

### General information
In JASS 2024 we will work with the following core technologies:
* Python
* LLMs and LangChain
* Linux environment (shell, ssh, bash)

This repo is the admission task template. It contains two assignments. You can implement one of them. Assignments are located in folders task1 task2. Each of the folders contains file ASSIGNMENT.md with a problem description.

You have to implement your solution in python, commit and push to the repository before deadline.

### Before submit the solution

Please consider the following, before submitting solution
 * [ ] Check that you have a README.md file in the task folder which describes how to run your solution
 * [ ] Do not put sensitive information (like access tokens) into the repo. You have to use .env file to store it locally. In the README.md you have to specify which variables should be defined
 * [ ] Having automatic tests is very appreciated
 * [ ] Put all required python dependencies into requirements.txt 
 * [ ] Using docker and docker-compose will be a big plus
